An "always exploring" mindset means keeping curiosity alive and trying different things, even without clear goals.

**The good:**
1. Exposes you to new opportunities
2. Keeps you curious and humble
3. Prevents getting stuck in narrow thinking

**The tricky parts:**
1. Can lack focus when you need concrete results
2. Too many perspectives can create confusion
3. Makes it harder to develop strong convictions

I tend to lean exploratory, which led me to PhD life. Sometimes I wonder if more focus would be better. Exploration has expanded who I amâ€”researcher, singer, club leader, someone interested in law, ethics, and many other things. But as I see how interconnected everything is, I find it harder to get genuinely excited about any single thing anymore.
