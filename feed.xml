It prioritizes staying open, trying different things, and postponing strong conclusions, especially when goals are unclear or the problem space feels too large to fully grasp.</p> <p>This mindset has real strengths.</p> <p>The good: 1. It exposes you to unexpected opportunities that structured plans often miss. 2. It keeps curiosity alive and encourages intellectual humility. 3. It helps prevent getting stuck in narrow thinking or overfitting to early assumptions.</p> <p>In many ways, this mindset is rewarded early on. It aligns well with learning, research, and environments where the cost of being wrong is low and exploration itself is the objective.</p> <p>But the same mindset has limits.</p> <p>The tricky parts: 1. It can dilute focus when concrete results or decisions are required. 2. Accumulating too many perspectives can create confusion rather than clarity. 3. It makes it harder to form strong convictions and act decisively.</p> <p>I naturally lean toward exploration, and that tendency is part of what led me to a PhD. Over time, it has expanded who I am: a researcher, a singer, a club leader, and someone curious about law, ethics, and many other domains.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the more I explore, the more interconnected everything starts to feel. As those connections accumulate, it becomes harder to feel genuinely excited about any single thing. When every path seems defensible and every framework feels incomplete, commitment starts to feel arbitrary rather than energizing.</p> <p>This makes me wonder whether the challenge is not exploration itself, but when to stop exploring. An always-exploring mindset is powerful when the goal is understanding. It may be less effective when the goal is impact, creation, or long-term direction.</p> <p>Perhaps growth is not about choosing between exploration and focus, but about learning when openness should give way to conviction, even if that conviction is imperfect.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thoughts"/><category term="research"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you always need a clear goal?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Finding Joy in Deep Work</title><link href="https://essoz.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Finding Joy in Deep Work"/><published>2025-08-10T21:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-10T21:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://essoz.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://essoz.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<p>During my research internship this summer, I found myself facing a familiar pressure: the need to produce something tangible from the experience.</p> <p>The expected output was a research paper. While the research itself was interesting, it felt incomplete—we had insights but limited supporting data, and the formal analysis was still developing. Writing felt premature and artificial. After a week of trying, I found myself resistant to continuing in this direction.</p> <p>This experience highlighted something I value: the satisfaction that comes from diving deep into meaningful problems and engaging with genuine intellectual challenges. Sometimes the process of understanding matters more than the immediate output.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thoughts"/><category term="research"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on what makes research meaningful]]></summary></entry></feed>
