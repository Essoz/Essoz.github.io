Sometimes I wonder if more focus would be better. Exploration has expanded who I am—researcher, singer, club leader, someone interested in law, ethics, and many other things.

While the research itself was interesting, it felt incomplete—we had insights but limited supporting data, and the formal analysis was still developing. Writing felt premature and artificial. After a week of trying, I found myself resistant to continuing in this direction.</p> <p>This experience highlighted something I value: the satisfaction that comes from diving deep into meaningful problems and engaging with genuine intellectual challenges. Sometimes the process of understanding matters more than the immediate output.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thoughts"/><category term="research"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on what makes research meaningful]]></summary></entry></feed>
