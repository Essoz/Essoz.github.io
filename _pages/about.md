Welcome! I'm Yuxuan Jiang. I'm currently a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/).

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering from the [Zhejiang University - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Joint Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en).

### Research Interests

My academic focus is primarily on enhancing the reliability of emerging systems, including but not limited to machine learning platforms and container orchestration frameworks. 

### Collaborations

Before joining the University of Michigan, I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with accomplished researchers in the field. 

- I worked with [Dr. Shilin He](https://shilinhe.github.io) at Microsoft Research Asia, exploring various topics related to cloud reliability and AIOps. 

- Additionally, I've had the privilege of working with [Prof. Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and [Prof. Owolabi Legunsen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/) at Cornell University, focusing on software correctness in container orchestration systems.

### Personal Interests

Beyond the world of research and coding, I have a passion for singing and mountain biking. I also love making new friends and skating across campus on my skateboard at breakneck speeds.

Feel free to explore the rest of my site to learn more about my work, or get in touch if you're interested in collaborating. Thank you for visiting!
