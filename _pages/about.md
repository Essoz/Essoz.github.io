Welcome! I am Yuxuan Jiang, a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, working on system correctness and reliability for large-scale, distributed, machine-learning, and agentic systems.

My research is motivated by a simple but persistent observation: **while code generation and system performance continue to scale rapidly, system correctness still depends heavily on time-consuming, expert-driven review.** 

I aim to develop general principles and practical techniques that improve correctness in settings where specifications are incomplete or implicit. My work focuses on automated reasoning, proactive checking, and effective bug diagnosis, helping systems detect when they are behaving incorrectly even when “correctness” is not explicitly defined.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/). Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research in Seattle and Beijing. I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/)￼and the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).
