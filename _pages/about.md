Hello there!

My name is Yuxuan (Matt) Jiang. I am about to join University of Michigan Ann-Arbor as a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering. I received my B.E. in Computer Engineering from [Zhejiang University - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign joint institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en) in 2023 summer.

My research interest lies in the general distributed systems. More specifically, I am currently exploring the topics of AIOps, software correctness and low-latency systems for resource disaggregation. My vision is to make computing power an accessible infrastructure for everyone, by pushing the efficiency, reliability and security of distributed systems.

I am currently an intern at Microsoft Research, working with [Dr. Shilin He](https://shilinhe.github.io) on various cloud reliability topics related to AIOps. I have also worked with [Prof. Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) at UIUC and [Prof. Owolabi Legunsen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/) at Cornell University on software correctness issues in container orchestration systems.

Besides research and coding, I enjoy singing, mountain biking, making friends and speeding on my skateboard across the campus.
