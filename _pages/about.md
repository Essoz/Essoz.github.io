Welcome! I'm Yuxuan Jiang, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/). Previously, I interned at MSR-Asia and earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) and [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).

I am interested broadly in Systems Reliability, Systems for Machine Learning, and AIOps. Beyond the world of research and coding, I have a passion for singing and mountain biking. I am the president of an all-Chinese A Cappella group here at Michigan.
